# Bravo
Bravo hopes to provide basic common components with a variety of databases and big data, which can help you reduce a lot of development costs when writing databases

First of all, Bravo will first implement an SQL parser to parse MySQL's DML, DDL, DCL and other syntax (including stored procedures), and further increase syntax support for PostgreSQL, sqlserver, spark and so on

In the future, Bravo will provide more components other than SQL parsing. For example, you can coordinate the behavior between redis and the database in a simpler way
