# Bravo
Bravo hopes to provide common components of databases and big data, which can help you reduce a lot of development costs when writing databases.

First of all, Bravo will implement an SQL parser to parse MySQL's DML, DDL, DCL syntax (including stored procedures), and further increase syntax support for PostgreSQL, SQLServer, Spark, Hive and so on.

In the future, Bravo will provide more components. For example, Bravo may provide a plug-in of connection pool, so that you can coordinate the behavior between redis and the database in a simpler way.


## Phase 1: Complete common syntax, extend MySQL syntax
